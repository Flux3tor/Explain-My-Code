# Explain My Code
Explain My Code is a web tool that helps developers understand unfamiliar code quickly.

Paste in a code snippet and get a clear explanation of what it does, a line-by-line breakdown, potential bugs or bad practices, and suggestions for improvement.

The goal is to make reading other people’s code less intimidating, especially for beginners, while still being useful for more experienced developers.

What’s next: improving explanation clarity, adding difficulty levels (beginner → advanced), and refining the UI based on feedback.
